================================================================================
              COMPLETE PROMPT ENGINEERING GUIDE FOR DEVELOPERS
                    All Concepts Organized in One Place
================================================================================


================================================================================
SECTION 1: FUNDAMENTALS - THE 8 CORE TIPS
================================================================================

TIP #1: USE XML TAGS
--------------------
Why: LLMs (especially Claude) were trained on XML-structured data. Tags help
     the model distinguish instructions from data.

How: Structure your prompt like this:

    <role>You are a backend developer.</role>
    <data>[paste your code or logs here]</data>
    <task>Find the bug causing the null pointer exception.</task>

Think of it like: Passing well-named parameters to a function instead of
                  one giant concatenated string.


TIP #2: BE SPECIFIC (THE "DIMWITTED INTERN" RULE)
-------------------------------------------------
Why: Vague words like "short" or "analyze" leave room for interpretation.
     The model will guess, and it often guesses wrong.

How: Quantify everything.

    BAD:  "Keep it short."
    GOOD: "Limit your response to exactly 3 bullet points."

    BAD:  "Analyze this code."
    GOOD: "List the top 5 performance bottlenecks in this code."

Think of it like: Writing a detailed Jira ticket vs. "fix the bug"


TIP #3: MIMIC THE DESIRED TONE
------------------------------
Why: LLMs are prediction engines. They complete the pattern you start.
     Sloppy input = sloppy output. Professional input = professional output.

How: Write your prompt in the same style you want the response.
     Want a formal technical doc? Write the prompt formally.
     Want casual Slack message? Write casually.


TIP #4: PROOFREAD YOUR PROMPTS
------------------------------
Why: Typos and grammar errors are "noise." They signal low-quality context,
     which pushes the model toward lower-quality output.

How: Treat prompts like production code. Review before sending.
     - Capitalize sentences
     - Fix typos
     - Use proper punctuation


TIP #5: WRITE IN YOUR STRONGEST LANGUAGE
----------------------------------------
Why: If you write in a language you're not fluent in, you'll use weird
     phrasing that confuses the model.

How: Write in your native language, even if you want output in English.
     The model translates better than you write awkward prompts.


TIP #6: PREFILLING (PRIME THE RESPONSE)
---------------------------------------
Why: This skips the "Sure! I'd be happy to help..." filler and forces
     the model into your desired format immediately.

How: End your prompt by starting the response yourself.

    Your prompt: "Convert this to JSON."
    Add at the end: "Here is the JSON: {"

    The model will continue from "{" directly into JSON format.

Think of it like: Stubbing out a function signature so the AI fills in the body.


TIP #7: AVOID NEGATIVE PROMPTING
--------------------------------
Why: "Don't think of a pink elephant" makes you think of it.
     LLMs struggle with negation the same way.

How: Tell the model what TO do, not what NOT to do.

    BAD:  "Don't write long sentences."
    GOOD: "Write short sentences under 15 words."

    BAD:  "Don't use technical jargon."
    GOOD: "Use simple language a non-developer would understand."


TIP #8: PUT INSTRUCTIONS IN USER MESSAGE (NOT SYSTEM)
-----------------------------------------------------
Why: The model pays more attention to User messages for execution details.
     System messages are better for high-level role setting.

How:
    System Prompt: "You are a senior Python developer." (simple)
    User Prompt:   [All your actual instructions, data, XML tags] (complex)


================================================================================
SECTION 2: DELIMITERS - HOW TO SEPARATE SECTIONS
================================================================================

Delimiters help the AI know where instructions end and data begins.
Pick one style and stay consistent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DELIMITER TYPE        | BEST FOR                  | EXAMPLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Triple Quotes """     | Text blocks, articles     | """paste text here"""
XML Tags <tag>        | Complex, structured       | <input>data</input>
Markdown Headers ###  | Readable, organized       | ### Task
Colons and Labels     | Simple key-value          | INSTRUCTION: do this
Dashes ---            | Code blocks               | --- code here ---
Brackets [ ]          | Parameters, options       | [TONE]: Professional
BEGIN/END Markers     | Clear boundaries          | BEGIN TEXT ... END TEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES OF EACH DELIMITER TYPE:

1. TRIPLE QUOTES
   ----------------
   Summarize the following article:

   """
   Climate change is affecting global temperatures. Scientists report 
   that 2024 was the hottest year on record.
   """

2. XML TAGS (Most reliable for complex prompts)
   ----------------
   You are a translator.

   <input_text>
   I love programming.
   </input_text>

   <target_language>
   Spanish
   </target_language>

   Translate the input text to the target language.

3. MARKDOWN HEADERS
   ----------------
   ### Role
   You are a helpful teacher.

   ### Task
   Explain this concept simply.

   ### Concept
   Photosynthesis

   ### Audience
   10-year-old student

4. COLONS AND LABELS
   ----------------
   INSTRUCTION: Fix the grammar errors.
   TEXT: She go to school yesterday and buyed a book.
   OUTPUT FORMAT: Corrected sentence only.

5. DASHES
   ----------------
   Review the code below for bugs.

   ---
   def add(a, b)
       return a + b
   ---

   List any errors found.

6. BRACKETS
   ----------------
   Write an email with these details:

   [TONE]: Professional
   [PURPOSE]: Meeting request
   [RECIPIENT]: Manager

7. BEGIN/END MARKERS
   ----------------
   Extract all names from this text:

   BEGIN TEXT
   John met Sarah at the coffee shop. Later, Michael joined them.
   END TEXT


WHY DELIMITERS MATTER:

   BAD (no delimiter):
   Translate hello world to French

   GOOD (with delimiter):
   Translate the following to French:
   """
   hello world
   """

The delimiter prevents confusion when your text contains words that
could be mistaken for instructions.


================================================================================
SECTION 3: CORE PROMPTING TACTICS (6 ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUES)
================================================================================

TACTIC 1: SET CLEAR GOALS
-------------------------
What it means: Tell the AI EXACTLY what you want.

Formula: [Action] + [Format] + [Length] + [Audience]

BAD:  "Write something about APIs"
GOOD: "Write a 5-bullet summary of REST APIs for junior developers"

Examples:
  - "Write a 200-word explanation for a beginner."
  - "List the top 3 issues in bullet points."
  - "Generate a table comparing options A, B, and C."


TACTIC 2: GIVE CONTEXT
----------------------
What it means: Tell the AI the background and purpose.

Why: More context = better, more relevant answers.

BAD:  "Summarize this."
GOOD: "This is a customer complaint email. Summarize the main issue
       and the customer's desired resolution for our support team."

Template:
  "This is for [purpose/project]. The audience is [who].
   Based on this, [task]."


TACTIC 3: FEW-SHOT PROMPTING (SHOW EXAMPLES)
--------------------------------------------
What it means: Show 1-2 examples of what you want, then say "now do this."

Why: You're teaching by demonstration.

Example:
  Input: Cat -> Output: A small furry mammal with whiskers.
  Input: Dog -> Output: A domesticated canine known for loyalty.
  
  Now do the same for: Elephant.

Use this when:
  - You want a specific format
  - You want a specific tone
  - The AI keeps misunderstanding you


TACTIC 4: BE SPECIFIC
---------------------
What it means: Remove all vague words. Quantify everything.

BAD                              GOOD
--------------------------       ----------------------------------
"Keep it short"                  "Limit to 3 sentences"
"Analyze this"                   "List the top 5 issues"
"Make it better"                 "Improve readability and add comments"
"Write about climate"            "Write 200 words arguing for carbon tax"


TACTIC 5: ITERATE (TRY, FIX, TRY AGAIN)
---------------------------------------
What it means: The first answer is rarely perfect. Refine it.

Common follow-ups:
  - "Make it shorter."
  - "Use simpler words."
  - "Add a code example."
  - "Focus more on [specific part]."
  - "Remove the introduction, just give me the answer."

This is normal. Expect 2-3 rounds of refinement.


TACTIC 6: CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (STEP-BY-STEP)
-----------------------------------------
What it means: Ask the AI to show its reasoning.

When to use: Math, logic, debugging, decisions, complex analysis.

Trigger phrases:
  - "Solve this step by step."
  - "Explain your reasoning."
  - "First list your assumptions, then give the answer."
  - "Walk me through your thought process."

Example:
  "To decide if we should use Strategy A or B, consider:
   (1) Performance impact
   (2) Implementation effort
   (3) Maintainability
   Then give a short conclusion with your recommendation."


================================================================================
SECTION 4: PROMPT TYPES & WHEN TO USE THEM
================================================================================

TYPE              | USE CASE                  | PRO TIP
------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------
Open-ended        | Brainstorming, explain    | Add constraints to focus it
Specific/Closed   | Fact retrieval, lookup    | "Answer ONLY from provided text"
Multiple choice   | Classification            | "Return only the letter"
Hypothetical      | Scenario planning         | Ask AI to list assumptions first
Opinion-based     | Debate, perspectives      | Give a specific stance to argue

For code specifically:
- Code Completion:   Ask for error handling + docstrings
- Code Translation:  "Use idiomatic [target language] conventions"
- Code Optimization: "Explain Big O before and after"
- Code Debugging:    "Explain root cause, then fix, then prevention tip"


================================================================================
SECTION 5: MASTER FRAMEWORKS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 R-C-T-F FRAMEWORK (General Purpose)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy-paste this structure for most prompts:

# ROLE
Act as an expert [JOB TITLE, e.g., DevOps Engineer, Data Scientist].

# CONTEXT
I am working on [PROJECT/GOAL, e.g., debugging a production issue,
writing API documentation].

# TASK
[SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION, e.g., Review this code and identify memory leaks].

# CONSTRAINTS & FORMAT
- Tone: [Professional / Casual / Technical]
- Length: [e.g., under 200 words, 5 bullet points]
- Output Format: [e.g., JSON, Markdown table, numbered list]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 S.P.E.C. FRAMEWORK (Coding-Specific)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When asking for code, always specify:

S - Stack:    Language, version, libraries (e.g., "Python 3.10 with Pandas")
P - Pattern:  Style guide (e.g., "PEP8", "OOP", "Functional")
E - Errors:   Edge cases and exception handling
C - Comments: Request docstrings/inline comments

Example:

# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
Python 3.10

# THE GOAL
I need a function that parses a CSV file and removes duplicate emails.

# REQUIREMENTS
1. Robustness: Handle edge cases (empty file, malformed rows). Include try/catch.
2. Style: Follow PEP8 conventions.
3. Documentation: Include docstrings explaining the logic.
4. Efficiency: Aim for O(n) time complexity.

# INPUT DATA
CSV with columns: name, email, signup_date

# OUTPUT
Provide the code in a single block, followed by a brief explanation
of how it handles errors.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3 UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE (Works for almost anything)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a [ROLE: e.g., teacher, Java expert, designer].

Task:
[What do you want? One simple sentence.]

Context:
[Anything the AI should know: project, problem, background.]

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Output format:
[bullets / short paragraph / code only / table / etc.]

Target audience:
[who will read this? e.g., beginner, manager, developer]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4 THE PERFECT PROMPT FORMULA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When stuck, fill in this formula:

"Act as a [ROLE].
 Create a [TASK].
 Show it as [FORMAT].
 And ensure you [CONSTRAINT/TONE]."

Examples:

1. "Act as a fitness coach.
    Create a meal plan for next week.
    Show it as a table with days of the week.
    And ensure you include calorie counts for every meal."

2. "Act as a senior Java developer.
    Create a utility class for date formatting.
    Show it as clean, documented code.
    And ensure you follow Java naming conventions."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5 HALLUCINATION-PROOF FORMULA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minimizes AI making things up.

Formula: [Context/Data] + [Task] + [Strict Constraint] + [Escape Hatch]

COMPONENT 1: THE CONTEXT (GROUNDING)
Instead of relying on AI's training data, PROVIDE the source material.

BAD:  "What is Company X's return policy?"
GOOD: "Context: [Paste the return policy text here]"

COMPONENT 2: THE TASK
State exactly what you want done with that context.
"Task: Summarize the refund timeline."

COMPONENT 3: THE STRICT CONSTRAINT
Lock the AI to ONLY your provided information.
"Answer using ONLY the information provided in the Context above.
 Do not use outside knowledge."

COMPONENT 4: THE ESCAPE HATCH (CRUCIAL)
Give the AI permission to say "I don't know" instead of guessing.
"If the answer is not contained in the context, state
 'Information not available'. Do not guess."

Full Example:
-------------
Context:
"""
[Paste company policy / documentation / code here]
"""

Task: Extract all deadlines mentioned in this document.

Constraint: Use ONLY the information above. Do not add external knowledge.

Escape Hatch: If no deadlines are found, say "No deadlines found in document."


================================================================================
SECTION 6: KEYWORD CATEGORIES
================================================================================

Keywords are "steering wheels" - they tell the AI which direction to go,
how fast to drive, and what destination to reach.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 1: IDENTITY KEYWORDS (Who should the AI be?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These assign a "persona" to the AI.

KEYWORD              | EXAMPLE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"Act as..."          | "Act as a senior software engineer"
"You are a..."       | "You are a strict code reviewer"
"Simulate..."        | "Simulate a job interview for a backend role"
"Pretend you are..." | "Pretend you are a database administrator"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 2: ACTION KEYWORDS (What should the AI do?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vague verbs = vague results. Be specific about the ACTION.

INSTEAD OF "WRITE"   | USE THESE MORE SPECIFIC VERBS
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
                     | Draft, Outline, Brainstorm, Compose, Script

INSTEAD OF "LOOK AT" | USE THESE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
                     | Analyze, Critique, Proofread, Summarize, Extract

INSTEAD OF "CHANGE"  | USE THESE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
                     | Rephrase, Simplify, Translate, Expand, Condense

INSTEAD OF "FIX"     | USE THESE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
                     | Debug, Refactor, Optimize, Patch, Correct


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 3: FORMAT KEYWORDS (What should the output look like?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without format instructions, the AI guesses (usually a wall of text).

KEYWORD              | WHEN TO USE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"Table"              | Comparing items, organizing data
"Bullet points"      | Lists, summaries, quick reads
"Step-by-step"       | Tutorials, processes, instructions
"Markdown"           | Headers, bold, structured documents
"CSV"                | Data for Excel/spreadsheets
"JSON"               | Structured data for code
"Code only"          | When you just want the code block
"Numbered list"      | Sequential items, rankings


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 4: TONE & AUDIENCE KEYWORDS (How should it sound?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These control the "voice" of the response.

KEYWORD              | EFFECT
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"ELI5"               | Explain Like I'm 5 - ultra simple
"Professional"       | Formal, workplace appropriate
"Concise" / "Brief"  | Cuts out fluff, gets to the point
"Empathetic"         | Softer tone for difficult messages
"Technical"          | Uses jargon, assumes expertise
"For a [audience]"   | "For a beginner" / "For a CEO" / "For a child"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 5: CONSTRAINT KEYWORDS (What are the guardrails?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These STOP the AI from doing things you don't want.

KEYWORD              | EXAMPLE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"Only"               | "Give me the code only, no explanation"
"Limit to"           | "Limit to 3 sentences"
"Do not"             | "Do not use technical jargon"
"In the style of"    | "Write in the style of Shakespeare"
"Exclude"            | "Exclude any marketing language"
"Focus on"           | "Focus only on security issues"

SECTION 9: CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (CoT) PROMPTING
================================================================================

Chain-of-Thought forces the AI to "show its work" instead of jumping to
an answer. Essential for math, logic, and debugging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.1 THE "GOLDEN" TRIGGER PHRASE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The single most effective phrase to activate CoT reasoning:

>>> "Let's think step by step."

This one phrase can dramatically improve accuracy on complex problems.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.2 CORE CoT KEYWORDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REASONING TRIGGERS:
- "think step by step"
- "show your reasoning"
- "explain your thinking"
- "break the problem down"
- "reason it out in stages"

PLANNING TRIGGERS:
- "outline your plan before answering"
- "first analyze, then answer"
- "list the steps needed"
- "identify the subproblems"

VERIFICATION TRIGGERS:
- "check your work"
- "verify each step"
- "double-check your reasoning"
- "look for edge cases"

STRUCTURE TRIGGERS:
- "first... then... finally..."
- "use numbered steps"
- "separate analysis and final answer"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.3 THE CoT TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[CONTEXT/ROLE]
Act as a [Role, e.g., Senior Developer / Mathematician].

[THE TASK]
Here is the problem: [Insert your complex problem here]

[THE TRIGGER - KEYWORDS]
Please solve this by following these rules:
1. Let's think step by step.
2. Break it down into clear components.
3. Show your work for every step.
4. Therefore, provide the final answer only after the reasoning trace.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.4 CoT EXAMPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 1: MATH PROBLEM

Without CoT:
"If a store offers 25% off $80, then 10% off the sale price, what's final?"

With CoT:
"If a store offers 25% off $80, then 10% off the sale price, what's final?
Think step by step and show your calculations."

AI Output:
Step 1: Calculate 25% off $80 → $80 × 0.25 = $20 discount → $60
Step 2: Calculate 10% off $60 → $60 × 0.10 = $6 discount → $54
Final price: $54


EXAMPLE 2: DEBUGGING CODE

Without CoT:
"Why isn't this code working? for i in range(5): print(i + 1"

With CoT:
"Why isn't this code working? Break it down piece by piece and identify
the issue. for i in range(5): print(i + 1"

AI Output:
Step 1: Check syntax → missing closing parenthesis on print()
Step 2: Should be print(i + 1)
Fix: Add the missing ) at the end.

<context>
I'm debugging a production issue in our Java Spring Boot application.
The audience for this analysis is the backend team.
</context>

<task>
Analyze the stack trace below. Identify:
1. The root cause of the exception
2. The exact line/method where it originates
3. Two potential fixes ranked by implementation effort
</task>

<stack_trace>
[paste your stack trace here]

================================================================================
END OF COMPLETE PROMPT ENGINEERING GUIDE
================================================================================

TIP: USE THE TECHNICAL TERM
If you know the concept name (Mutex, Circuit Breaker, Memoization),
use it. The AI will instantly treat you as an expert and respond
accordingly.

TIP: IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE TERM
Ask: "What is the engineering term for when I want to stop my app
from calling a broken API?"
Answer: "Circuit Breaker"
Then use that keyword in your actual prompt.
