                         PROMPTING TYPES GUIDE
================================================================================

This guide explains different ways to ask AI questions and when to use each.


================================================================================
PART 1: GENERAL PROMPTING TYPES
================================================================================

1. OPEN-ENDED PROMPTS
---------------------
What it is:  A broad question with no single right answer.
Example:     "How can I be healthier?"
Use when:    You want ideas, explanations, or creativity.
Pro tip:     Add constraints to focus the response.
             Example: "Give me 5 budget-friendly ways to be healthier."


2. SPECIFIC/CLOSED PROMPTS
--------------------------
What it is:  A question with one exact answer.
Example:     "How many days are in February during a leap year?"
Use when:    You need a fact or a short answer.
Pro tip:     Say "Answer ONLY from provided text" if you gave context.


3. MULTIPLE CHOICE PROMPTS
--------------------------
What it is:  You give options to pick from.
Example:     "Is this review positive, negative, or neutral?"
Use when:    You want the AI to categorize or classify something.
Pro tip:     Say "Return only the letter" for cleaner output.


4. HYPOTHETICAL PROMPTS
-----------------------
What it is:  "What if" questions.
Example:     "What would happen if I didn't water my plants for a month?"
Use when:    You want to explore possibilities or plan ahead.
Pro tip:     Ask the AI to list its assumptions first.


5. OPINION-BASED PROMPTS
------------------------
What it is:  Ask the AI to argue a side.
Example:     "Give me 3 reasons why dogs are better than cats."
Use when:    You want to see different perspectives or build an argument.
Pro tip:     Give a specific stance to argue for clearer results.


================================================================================
PART 2: CODE-SPECIFIC PROMPTING TYPES
================================================================================

1. CODE COMPLETION
------------------
What it is:  You have partial code and want the AI to finish it.
Example:     "Complete this function that calculates the average of a list."
Use when:    You have started code but need help finishing it.
Pro tip:     Also ask for error handling and comments.

Better prompt example:
    "Complete this function AND add error handling if the list is empty.
     Include docstrings explaining what the function does."


2. CODE TRANSLATION
-------------------
What it is:  Convert code from one language to another.
Example:     "Convert this Python code to JavaScript."
Use when:    You need the same logic in a different programming language.
Pro tip:     Ask it to use the new language's best practices.

Better prompt example:
    "Convert this Python code to JavaScript using modern ES6 conventions.
     Use arrow functions and const/let instead of var."


3. CODE OPTIMIZATION
--------------------
What it is:  Make your code faster or cleaner.
Example:     "Make this function run faster."
Use when:    Your code works but is slow or messy.
Pro tip:     Ask it to explain the speed improvement.

Better prompt example:
    "Optimize this function and explain:
     - The Big O complexity before optimization
     - The Big O complexity after optimization
     - Why the new version is faster"


4. CODE DEBUGGING
-----------------
What it is:  Your code has a bug and you need help fixing it.
Example:     "Why isn't this working?"
Use when:    Your code has errors or unexpected behavior.
Pro tip:     Ask for three things: cause, fix, and prevention.

Better prompt example:
    "My code has a bug. Please tell me:
     1. What is causing this bug (root cause)
     2. How to fix it (solution)
     3. How to avoid this mistake next time (prevention tip)"
