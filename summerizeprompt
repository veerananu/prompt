                    PROMPT ENGINEERING GUIDE FOR DEVELOPERS
================================================================================

Hey! Here's a breakdown of prompt engineering fundamentals. Think of this as
the "clean code" principles but for talking to LLMs.

================================================================================
PART 1: THE 8 CORE TIPS
================================================================================

TIP #1: USE XML TAGS
--------------------
Why: LLMs (especially Claude) were trained on XML-structured data. Tags help
     the model distinguish instructions from data.

How: Structure your prompt like this:

    <role>You are a backend developer.</role>
    <data>[paste your code or logs here]</data>
    <task>Find the bug causing the null pointer exception.</task>

Think of it like: Passing well-named parameters to a function instead of
                  one giant concatenated string.


TIP #2: BE SPECIFIC (THE "DIMWITTED INTERN" RULE)
-------------------------------------------------
Why: Vague words like "short" or "analyze" leave room for interpretation.
     The model will guess, and it often guesses wrong.

How: Quantify everything.

    BAD:  "Keep it short."
    GOOD: "Limit your response to exactly 3 bullet points."

    BAD:  "Analyze this code."
    GOOD: "List the top 5 performance bottlenecks in this code."

Think of it like: Writing a detailed Jira ticket vs. "fix the bug"


TIP #3: MIMIC THE DESIRED TONE
------------------------------
Why: LLMs are prediction engines. They complete the pattern you start.
     Sloppy input = sloppy output. Professional input = professional output.

How: Write your prompt in the same style you want the response.
     Want a formal technical doc? Write the prompt formally.
     Want casual Slack message? Write casually.


TIP #4: PROOFREAD YOUR PROMPTS
------------------------------
Why: Typos and grammar errors are "noise." They signal low-quality context,
     which pushes the model toward lower-quality output.

How: Treat prompts like production code. Review before sending.
     - Capitalize sentences
     - Fix typos
     - Use proper punctuation


TIP #5: WRITE IN YOUR STRONGEST LANGUAGE
----------------------------------------
Why: If you write in a language you're not fluent in, you'll use weird
     phrasing that confuses the model.

How: Write in your native language, even if you want output in English.
     The model translates better than you write awkward prompts.


TIP #6: PREFILLING (PRIME THE RESPONSE)
---------------------------------------
Why: This skips the "Sure! I'd be happy to help..." filler and forces
     the model into your desired format immediately.

How: End your prompt by starting the response yourself.

    Your prompt: "Convert this to JSON."
    Add at the end: "Here is the JSON: {"

    The model will continue from "{" directly into JSON format.

Think of it like: Stubbing out a function signature so the AI fills in the body.


TIP #7: AVOID NEGATIVE PROMPTING
--------------------------------
Why: "Don't think of a pink elephant" makes you think of it.
     LLMs struggle with negation the same way.

How: Tell the model what TO do, not what NOT to do.

    BAD:  "Don't write long sentences."
    GOOD: "Write short sentences under 15 words."

    BAD:  "Don't use technical jargon."
    GOOD: "Use simple language a non-developer would understand."


TIP #8: PUT INSTRUCTIONS IN USER MESSAGE (NOT SYSTEM)
-----------------------------------------------------
Why: The model pays more attention to User messages for execution details.
     System messages are better for high-level role setting.

How:
    System Prompt: "You are a senior Python developer." (simple)
    User Prompt:   [All your actual instructions, data, XML tags] (complex)


================================================================================
PART 2: THE MASTER TEMPLATE (R-C-T-F FRAMEWORK)
================================================================================

Copy-paste this structure for most prompts:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ROLE
Act as an expert [JOB TITLE, e.g., DevOps Engineer, Data Scientist].

# CONTEXT
I am working on [PROJECT/GOAL, e.g., debugging a production issue,
writing API documentation].

# TASK
[SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION, e.g., Review this code and identify memory leaks].

# CONSTRAINTS & FORMAT
- Tone: [Professional / Casual / Technical]
- Length: [e.g., under 200 words, 5 bullet points]
- Output Format: [e.g., JSON, Markdown table, numbered list]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


================================================================================
PART 3: CODING-SPECIFIC TEMPLATE (S.P.E.C. FRAMEWORK)
================================================================================

When asking for code, always specify:

S - Stack:    Language, version, libraries (e.g., "Python 3.10 with Pandas")
P - Pattern:  Style guide (e.g., "PEP8", "OOP", "Functional")
E - Errors:   Edge cases and exception handling
C - Comments: Request docstrings/inline comments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
Python 3.10

# THE GOAL
I need a function that parses a CSV file and removes duplicate emails.

# REQUIREMENTS
1. Robustness: Handle edge cases (empty file, malformed rows). Include try/catch.
2. Style: Follow PEP8 conventions.
3. Documentation: Include docstrings explaining the logic.
4. Efficiency: Aim for O(n) time complexity.

# INPUT DATA
CSV with columns: name, email, signup_date

# OUTPUT
Provide the code in a single block, followed by a brief explanation
of how it handles errors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


================================================================================
PART 4: PROMPT TYPES & WHEN TO USE THEM
================================================================================

TYPE              | USE CASE                  | PRO TIP
------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------
Open-ended        | Brainstorming, explain    | Add constraints to focus it
Specific/Closed   | Fact retrieval, lookup    | "Answer ONLY from provided text"
Multiple choice   | Classification            | "Return only the letter"
Hypothetical      | Scenario planning         | Ask AI to list assumptions first
Opinion-based     | Debate, perspectives      | Give a specific stance to argue

For code specifically:
- Code Completion:   Ask for error handling + docstrings
- Code Translation:  "Use idiomatic [target language] conventions"
- Code Optimization: "Explain Big O before and after"
- Code Debugging:    "Explain root cause, then fix, then prevention tip"


================================================================================
PART 5: DELIMITERS (SEPARATING SECTIONS)
================================================================================

Pick one style and be consistent:

1. Triple Quotes (great for text blocks)
   """
   Your text here
   """

2. XML Tags (most reliable for complex prompts)
   <input>data here</input>
   <instructions>task here</instructions>

3. Markdown Headers
   ### Context
   ### Task
   ### Format

4. Dashes (good for code blocks)
   ---
   code here
   ---


================================================================================
PART 6: QUICK REFERENCE CHEAT SHEET
================================================================================

BEFORE SENDING ANY PROMPT, CHECK:

[ ] Did I use tags/delimiters to separate sections?
[ ] Did I specify exact numbers (word count, bullet count)?
[ ] Did I define the output format (JSON, table, list)?
[ ] Did I write in the tone I want back?
[ ] Did I proofread for typos?
[ ] Did I say what TO do (not what NOT to do)?
[ ] Did I specify the audience?


================================================================================
PART 7: REAL EXAMPLE - BUG ANALYSIS PROMPT
================================================================================

BAD PROMPT:
"Look at this error and tell me what's wrong."

GOOD PROMPT:

<context>
I'm debugging a production issue in our Java Spring Boot application.
The audience for this analysis is the backend team.
</context>

<task>
Analyze the stack trace below. Identify:
1. The root cause of the exception
2. The exact line/method where it originates
3. Two potential fixes ranked by implementation effort
</task>

<stack_trace>
[paste your stack trace here]
</stack_trace>

<format>
- Use a numbered list for the 3 items above
- Keep each point under 50 words
- Include code snippets for the fixes
</format>


================================================================================
TL;DR - THE GOLDEN RULES
================================================================================

1. STRUCTURE   -> Use XML tags or delimiters
2. SPECIFICITY -> Quantify everything, no vague words
3. TONE        -> Write how you want the output to sound
4. POSITIVE    -> Say what to do, not what to avoid
5. ITERATE     -> First draft is rarely perfect, refine it

================================================================================
END OF GUIDE
================================================================================


================================================================================
              PROMPT TEMPLATES & EXAMPLES - A DEVELOPER'S HANDBOOK
================================================================================

This guide gives you ready-to-use templates you can copy-paste immediately.
Think of it as a "starter kit" for talking to LLMs effectively.

================================================================================
PART 1: UNDERSTANDING DELIMITERS (HOW TO SEPARATE SECTIONS)
================================================================================

Delimiters help the AI know where instructions end and data begins.
Pick one style and stay consistent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DELIMITER TYPE        | BEST FOR                  | EXAMPLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Triple Quotes """     | Text blocks, articles     | """paste text here"""
XML Tags <tag>        | Complex, structured       | <input>data</input>
Markdown Headers ###  | Readable, organized       | ### Task
Colons and Labels     | Simple key-value          | INSTRUCTION: do this
Dashes ---            | Code blocks               | --- code here ---
Brackets [ ]          | Parameters, options       | [TONE]: Professional
BEGIN/END Markers     | Clear boundaries          | BEGIN TEXT ... END TEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES OF EACH:

1. TRIPLE QUOTES
   ----------------
   Summarize the following article:

   """
   Climate change is affecting global temperatures. Scientists report 
   that 2024 was the hottest year on record.
   """

2. XML TAGS (Most reliable for complex prompts)
   ----------------
   You are a translator.

   <input_text>
   I love programming.
   </input_text>

   <target_language>
   Spanish
   </target_language>

   Translate the input text to the target language.

3. MARKDOWN HEADERS
   ----------------
   ### Role
   You are a helpful teacher.

   ### Task
   Explain this concept simply.

   ### Concept
   Photosynthesis

   ### Audience
   10-year-old student

4. COLONS AND LABELS
   ----------------
   INSTRUCTION: Fix the grammar errors.
   TEXT: She go to school yesterday and buyed a book.
   OUTPUT FORMAT: Corrected sentence only.

5. DASHES
   ----------------
   Review the code below for bugs.

   ---
   def add(a, b)
       return a + b
   ---

   List any errors found.

6. BRACKETS
   ----------------
   Write an email with these details:

   [TONE]: Professional
   [PURPOSE]: Meeting request
   [RECIPIENT]: Manager

7. BEGIN/END MARKERS
   ----------------
   Extract all names from this text:

   BEGIN TEXT
   John met Sarah at the coffee shop. Later, Michael joined them.
   END TEXT


WHY DELIMITERS MATTER:

   BAD (no delimiter):
   Translate hello world to French

   GOOD (with delimiter):
   Translate the following to French:
   """
   hello world
   """

The delimiter prevents confusion when your text contains words that
could be mistaken for instructions.


================================================================================
PART 2: THE 6 CORE PROMPTING TACTICS (STEP BY STEP)
================================================================================

TACTIC 1: SET CLEAR GOALS
-------------------------
What it means: Tell the AI EXACTLY what you want.

Formula: [Action] + [Format] + [Length] + [Audience]

BAD:  "Write something about APIs"
GOOD: "Write a 5-bullet summary of REST APIs for junior developers"

Examples:
  - "Write a 200-word explanation for a beginner."
  - "List the top 3 issues in bullet points."
  - "Generate a table comparing options A, B, and C."


TACTIC 2: GIVE CONTEXT
----------------------
What it means: Tell the AI the background and purpose.

Why: More context = better, more relevant answers.

BAD:  "Summarize this."
GOOD: "This is a customer complaint email. Summarize the main issue
       and the customer's desired resolution for our support team."

Template:
  "This is for [purpose/project]. The audience is [who].
   Based on this, [task]."


TACTIC 3: FEW-SHOT PROMPTING (SHOW EXAMPLES)
--------------------------------------------
What it means: Show 1-2 examples of what you want, then say "now do this."

Why: You're teaching by demonstration.

Example:
  Input: Cat -> Output: A small furry mammal with whiskers.
  Input: Dog -> Output: A domesticated canine known for loyalty.
  
  Now do the same for: Elephant.

Use this when:
  - You want a specific format
  - You want a specific tone
  - The AI keeps misunderstanding you


TACTIC 4: BE SPECIFIC
---------------------
What it means: Remove all vague words. Quantify everything.

BAD                              GOOD
--------------------------       ----------------------------------
"Keep it short"                  "Limit to 3 sentences"
"Analyze this"                   "List the top 5 issues"
"Make it better"                 "Improve readability and add comments"
"Write about climate"            "Write 200 words arguing for carbon tax"


TACTIC 5: ITERATE (TRY, FIX, TRY AGAIN)
---------------------------------------
What it means: The first answer is rarely perfect. Refine it.

Common follow-ups:
  - "Make it shorter."
  - "Use simpler words."
  - "Add a code example."
  - "Focus more on [specific part]."
  - "Remove the introduction, just give me the answer."

This is normal. Expect 2-3 rounds of refinement.


TACTIC 6: CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (STEP-BY-STEP)
-----------------------------------------
What it means: Ask the AI to show its reasoning.

When to use: Math, logic, debugging, decisions, complex analysis.

Trigger phrases:
  - "Solve this step by step."
  - "Explain your reasoning."
  - "First list your assumptions, then give the answer."
  - "Walk me through your thought process."

Example:
  "To decide if we should use Strategy A or B, consider:
   (1) Performance impact
   (2) Implementation effort
   (3) Maintainability
   Then give a short conclusion with your recommendation."

Not sure / complex task       | Part 6 Universal


================================================================================
TL;DR - THE GOLDEN RULES
================================================================================

1. USE DELIMITERS     -> Separate instructions from data (XML, """, ---)
2. BE SPECIFIC        -> Numbers, formats, audiences - no vague words
3. GIVE CONTEXT       -> Background + purpose = better answers
4. SHOW EXAMPLES      -> Few-shot prompting when format matters
5. ASK FOR STEPS      -> Chain-of-thought for complex reasoning
6. ITERATE            -> Refine in 2-3 rounds, that's normal

================================================================================
         ADVANCED PROMPT ENGINEERING: KEYWORDS, FORMULAS & TECHNIQUES
                       A Developer's Complete Reference
================================================================================

This guide goes beyond basics. It covers the specific KEYWORDS that steer AI
responses, advanced formulas for accuracy, and coding-specific techniques.

Think of keywords as "steering wheels" - they tell the AI which direction to
go, how fast to drive, and what destination to reach.

================================================================================
PART 1: THE KEYWORD CATEGORIES
================================================================================

Keywords fall into 5 main categories. Master these, and you control the output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 1: IDENTITY KEYWORDS (Who should the AI be?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These assign a "persona" to the AI. It switches from generic assistant to
specialist mode.

KEYWORD              | EXAMPLE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"Act as..."          | "Act as a senior software engineer"
"You are a..."       | "You are a strict code reviewer"
"Simulate..."        | "Simulate a job interview for a backend role"
"Pretend you are..." | "Pretend you are a database administrator"

WHY IT WORKS:
The AI has been trained on text from many perspectives. When you say
"Act as a senior engineer," you're telling it to weight its responses
toward that expertise level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 2: ACTION KEYWORDS (What should the AI do?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vague verbs = vague results. Be specific about the ACTION.

INSTEAD OF "WRITE"   | USE THESE MORE SPECIFIC VERBS
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
                     | Draft, Outline, Brainstorm, Compose, Script

INSTEAD OF "LOOK AT" | USE THESE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
                     | Analyze, Critique, Proofread, Summarize, Extract

INSTEAD OF "CHANGE"  | USE THESE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
                     | Rephrase, Simplify, Translate, Expand, Condense

INSTEAD OF "FIX"     | USE THESE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
                     | Debug, Refactor, Optimize, Patch, Correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 3: FORMAT KEYWORDS (What should the output look like?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without format instructions, the AI guesses (usually a wall of text).

KEYWORD              | WHEN TO USE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"Table"              | Comparing items, organizing data
"Bullet points"      | Lists, summaries, quick reads
"Step-by-step"       | Tutorials, processes, instructions
"Markdown"           | Headers, bold, structured documents
"CSV"                | Data for Excel/spreadsheets
"JSON"               | Structured data for code
"Code only"          | When you just want the code block
"Numbered list"      | Sequential items, rankings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 4: TONE & AUDIENCE KEYWORDS (How should it sound?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These control the "voice" of the response.

KEYWORD              | EFFECT
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"ELI5"               | Explain Like I'm 5 - ultra simple
"Professional"       | Formal, workplace appropriate
"Concise" / "Brief"  | Cuts out fluff, gets to the point
"Empathetic"         | Softer tone for difficult messages
"Technical"          | Uses jargon, assumes expertise
"For a [audience]"   | "For a beginner" / "For a CEO" / "For a child"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY 5: CONSTRAINT KEYWORDS (What are the guardrails?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These STOP the AI from doing things you don't want.

KEYWORD              | EXAMPLE
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"Only"               | "Give me the code only, no explanation"
"Limit to"           | "Limit to 3 sentences"
"Do not"             | "Do not use technical jargon"
"In the style of"    | "Write in the style of Shakespeare"
"Exclude"            | "Exclude any marketing language"
"Focus on"           | "Focus only on security issues"


================================================================================
PART 2: THE PERFECT PROMPT FORMULA
================================================================================

When stuck, fill in this formula:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Act as a [ROLE].
 Create a [TASK].
 Show it as [FORMAT].
 And ensure you [CONSTRAINT/TONE]."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES:

1. "Act as a fitness coach.
    Create a meal plan for next week.
    Show it as a table with days of the week.
    And ensure you include calorie counts for every meal."

2. "Act as a senior Java developer.
    Create a utility class for date formatting.
    Show it as clean, documented code.
    And ensure you follow Java naming conventions."

3. "Act as a tech writer.
    Create documentation for this API endpoint.
    Show it as Markdown with code examples.
    And ensure you write for junior developers."


================================================================================
PART 3: THE "HALLUCINATION-PROOF" FORMULA
================================================================================

LLMs can make things up (hallucinate). This formula minimizes that risk.

FORMULA:
[Context/Data] + [Task] + [Strict Constraint] + [Escape Hatch]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPONENT 1: THE CONTEXT (GROUNDING)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of relying on AI's training data, PROVIDE the source material.

BAD:  "What is Company X's return policy?"
GOOD: "Context: [Paste the return policy text here]"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPONENT 2: THE TASK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
State exactly what you want done with that context.

"Task: Summarize the refund timeline."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPONENT 3: THE STRICT CONSTRAINT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lock the AI to ONLY your provided information.

"Answer using ONLY the information provided in the Context above.
 Do not use outside knowledge."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPONENT 4: THE ESCAPE HATCH (CRUCIAL)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give the AI permission to say "I don't know" instead of guessing.

"If the answer is not contained in the context, state
 'Information not available'. Do not guess."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FULL EXAMPLE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Context:
"""
[Paste company policy / documentation / code here]
"""

Task: Extract all deadlines mentioned in this document.

Constraint: Use ONLY the information above. Do not add external knowledge.

Escape Hatch: If no deadlines are found, say "No deadlines found in document."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THE ESCAPE HATCH WORKS (Technical Explanation):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLMs are probabilistic engines. They predict the next likely token.

When you ask a vague question, the "probability cloud" of answers is huge,
and the model might pick something that sounds plausible but is wrong.

By adding "If you don't know, say so," you artificially boost the probability
of the "stop/unknown" token, making it easier for the model to choose
silence over creativity.


================================================================================
PART 4: CODING-SPECIFIC KEYWORDS
================================================================================

Code requires precision. These keywords are essential for programming tasks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 THE "STACK" KEYWORDS (Always specify these first)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you don't specify, the AI might give you Python 2 when you need Python 3,
or React class components when you want hooks.

---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
"In [Language]..."   | "In Python 3.11...", "In TypeScript..."
"Using [Framework]"  | "Using Spring Boot...", "Using React hooks..."
"Using [Library]"    | "Using Pandas...", "Using only standard library"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5 THE "MODERNIZATION" KEYWORDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI is trained on old AND new code. These force modern approaches.

KEYWORD             | EFFECT
--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------
"Modern"            | Latest syntax and approaches
"Deprecation-free"  | Avoid functions being removed in future versions

================================================================================
PART 9: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
================================================================================

MISTAKE                          | FIX
---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
Vague verbs ("look at this")     | Use specific verbs (analyze, debug, refactor)
No format specified              | Always say: table, bullets, code only, etc.
No audience specified            | Add "for a junior dev" or "for a manager"
Assuming AI knows context        | Provide background explicitly
Not specifying language/version  | Always say "Python 3.11" or "Java 17"

5. PROVIDE CONTEXT      -> Don't assume the AI knows your project
6. USE ESCAPE HATCHES   -> Let AI say "I don't know" vs. hallucinating
7. ITERATE              -> First answer rarely perfect, refine it

================================================================================
END OF GUIDE
================================================================================


================================================================================
          EXPERT PROMPT ENGINEERING: SENIOR DEVELOPER KEYWORDS
                    System Design, Security & Beyond
================================================================================

This guide covers ADVANCED keywords that distinguish a "coder" from a
"software engineer." These are essential for production systems, team
collaboration, and professional-grade code.

================================================================================
PART 1: POWER KEYWORDS - IDIOMATIC & SCAFFOLD
================================================================================

These two keywords are "force multipliers" - they save enormous time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 THE "IDIOMATIC" KEYWORD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IT DOES:
Tells the AI: "Don't just translate logic into this language; use the specific
features that make this language unique." It forces "native speaker" code
instead of "tourist" code.

WITHOUT "IDIOMATIC" (Generic/C-style Python):
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = []
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(numbers[i])
```
^ This works, but it looks like Java logic written in Python.

WITH "IDIOMATIC" (Pythonic):
Prompt: "Write Python to filter even numbers. Ensure code is idiomatic."

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```
^ Uses List Comprehension - faster and considered best practice in Python.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Prevents code that gets rejected in code reviews
- Uses language-specific optimizations
- Makes code more readable to native developers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 THE "SCAFFOLD" KEYWORD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IT DOES:
Builds the skeleton of a project (files, folders, imports) without writing
the inner logic. Gets you started instantly.

PROMPT EXAMPLE:
"Generate a project scaffold for a Node.js Express API. Include standard
folder structure and create placeholder files for routes and controllers.
Do not implement business logic yet."

OUTPUT:
```
/my-api
  /src
    /controllers
      userController.js
    /routes
      userRoutes.js
    app.js
  package.json
```

And stub code like this:
```javascript
// userController.js
exports.getAllUsers = (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement logic to fetch users from DB
  res.status(501).send("Not Implemented");
};

exports.createUser = (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement logic to create user
  res.status(501).send("Not Implemented");
};
```

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Saves 30+ minutes of boring setup time
- Ensures consistent project structure
- Gives you a clear starting point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 THE "RATIONALE" KEYWORD (BONUS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add this to understand WHY the AI made certain choices.

EXAMPLE:
"Refactor this function to be idiomatic. Explain your rationale."


================================================================================
PART 2: VISUAL & DIAGRAM KEYWORDS
================================================================================

Generate diagrams from text - incredibly useful for documentation.

KEYWORD        | OUTPUT TYPE                | EXAMPLE PROMPT
---------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------
"Mermaid"      | Flowcharts, sequence diags | "Create a Mermaid sequence diagram"
"Flowchart"    | Decision trees, processes  | "Visualize this if-else as flowchart"
"Graphviz/DOT" | Structural diagrams        | "Generate a Graphviz diagram"
"ASCII diagram"| Text-based visuals         | "Draw an ASCII diagram of this"

MERMAID EXAMPLE PROMPT:
"Create a Mermaid sequence diagram showing authentication flow between
User, API, and Database."

OUTPUT:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>API: Login Request
    API->>Database: Validate Credentials
    Database-->>API: User Data
    API-->>User: JWT Token
```

WHY MERMAID IS POWERFUL:
- Renders in GitHub, Notion, VS Code
- Version-controllable (it's just text)
- Easy to modify and share


================================================================================
PART 3: DEEP DEBUGGING KEYWORDS
================================================================================

Go beyond "fix this bug" to understand HOW code executes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD: "DRY RUN"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asks AI to mentally execute code and show variable states at each step.

PROMPT:
"Dry run this loop with input [1, 5, 10]. Show state of variables
'i' and 'total' at each iteration."

OUTPUT:
```
Iteration 1: i=1, total=1
Iteration 2: i=5, total=6
Iteration 3: i=10, total=16
Final: total=16
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD: "TRACE"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows the execution PATH taken through code.

PROMPT:
"Trace the execution path if user input is null."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD: "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of just fixing, explains WHY the bug happened.

PROMPT:
"The code fails with a timeout. Perform root cause analysis and suggest fixes."


================================================================================
PART 4: DEPENDENCY & LIBRARY KEYWORDS
================================================================================

Control what tools the AI is allowed to use.

KEYWORD              | MEANING                              | EXAMPLE
---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------
"Standard Library"   | No external packages                 | "Using standard library only"
"Lightweight"        | Avoid heavy frameworks               | "Suggest lightweight solution"
"Vendor-agnostic"    | Works on AWS AND Azure               | "Make it vendor-agnostic"
"No dependencies"    | Pure language, nothing extra         | "Solve with no dependencies"
"Minimal imports"    | Use fewest libraries possible        | "Keep imports minimal"

EXAMPLE PROMPT:
"Write a script to parse CSV files using standard library only (no Pandas)."


================================================================================
PART 5: STABILITY & OPERATIONS KEYWORDS
================================================================================

Essential for scripts and database operations in production.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD: "IDEMPOTENT" (CRITICAL FOR DEVOPS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEANING: "Safe to run multiple times without changing result after first run."

WHY IT MATTERS:
If your install script runs twice, it shouldn't fail or duplicate things.

PROMPT:
"Write a bash script to install Docker. Make it idempotent so it doesn't
fail if Docker is already installed."

OUTPUT PATTERN:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if ! command -v docker &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Installing Docker..."
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker.io
else
    echo "Docker already installed, skipping."
fi
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD: "ATOMIC"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEANING: "All operations succeed, or none of them happen."

WHY IT MATTERS:
Critical for financial transactions - you can't debit one account without
crediting another.

PROMPT:
"Write a function to transfer money between accounts. Ensure the transaction
is atomic so we don't lose money if system crashes halfway."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD: "GRACEFUL DEGRADATION"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEANING: "If main feature fails, fall back to something that still works."

PROMPT:
"Write a video player component. Implement graceful degradation so if
high-res fails, it plays low-res instead of showing an error."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY TABLE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD              | MEANING                    | USE CASE
---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------
Idempotent           | Safe to run twice          | Scripts, installers
Atomic               | All or nothing             | Database transactions
Graceful Degradation | Fallback on failure        | User-facing features
Fault-tolerant       | Survives partial failures  | Distributed systems


================================================================================
PART 6: ALGORITHMIC APPROACH KEYWORDS
================================================================================

Dictate HOW the computer solves a problem.

KEYWORD        | MEANING                              | WHEN TO USE
---------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------
"Recursive"    | Function calls itself                | Tree structures, math
"Iterative"    | Uses loops                           | Avoid stack overflow
"Greedy"       | Best choice at each step             | Optimization problems
"Brute Force"  | Try everything                       | When simplicity > speed
"Divide & Conquer" | Split problem into parts         | Sorting, searching

================================================================================
PART 11: CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (CoT) PROMPTING
================================================================================

Chain-of-Thought is a technique that forces the AI to "show its work"
instead of jumping to an answer. Essential for math, logic, and debugging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.1 THE "GOLDEN" TRIGGER PHRASE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The single most effective phrase to activate CoT reasoning:

>>> "Let's think step by step."

This one phrase can dramatically improve accuracy on complex problems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.2 CORE CoT KEYWORDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use 1-2 of these per prompt (not all at once):

REASONING TRIGGERS:
- "think step by step"
- "show your reasoning"
- "explain your thinking"
- "break the problem down"
- "reason it out in stages"
- "walk through this slowly"
- "explain each step clearly"
- "describe your thought process"

PLANNING TRIGGERS:
- "outline your plan before answering"
- "first analyze, then answer"
- "list the steps needed"
- "identify the subproblems"
- "start with a high-level plan, then details"

VERIFICATION TRIGGERS:
- "check your work"
- "verify each step"
- "double-check your reasoning"
- "look for edge cases"
- "explain why this solution is correct"

STRUCTURE TRIGGERS:
- "first... then... finally..."
- "use numbered steps"
- "separate analysis and final answer"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.3 THE CoT TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[CONTEXT/ROLE]
Act as a [Role, e.g., Senior Developer / Mathematician].

[THE TASK]
Here is the problem: [Insert your complex problem here]

[THE TRIGGER - KEYWORDS]
Please solve this by following these rules:
1. Let's think step by step.
2. Break it down into clear components.
3. Show your work for every step.
4. Therefore, provide the final answer only after the reasoning trace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.4 CoT EXAMPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE 1: MATH PROBLEM

Without CoT:
"If a store offers 25% off $80, then 10% off the sale price, what's final?"

With CoT:
"If a store offers 25% off $80, then 10% off the sale price, what's final?
Think step by step and show your calculations."

AI Output:
Step 1: Calculate 25% off $80 → $80 × 0.25 = $20 discount → $60
Step 2: Calculate 10% off $60 → $60 × 0.10 = $6 discount → $54
Final price: $54

---

EXAMPLE 2: LOGIC PUZZLE

Without CoT:
"Tom is taller than Jane. Jane is taller than Mike. Is Tom taller than Mike?"

With CoT:
"Tom is taller than Jane. Jane is taller than Mike. Is Tom taller than Mike?
Reason through this carefully before answering."

AI Output:
Tom > Jane (given)
Jane > Mike (given)
Therefore: Tom > Jane > Mike
Yes, Tom is taller than Mike.

---

EXAMPLE 3: DEBUGGING CODE

Without CoT:
"Why isn't this code working? for i in range(5): print(i + 1"

With CoT:
"Why isn't this code working? Break it down piece by piece and identify
the issue. for i in range(5): print(i + 1"

AI Output:
Step 1: Check syntax → missing closing parenthesis on print()
Step 2: Should be print(i + 1)
Fix: Add the missing ) at the end.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.5 CoT FOR JAVA/CODING SPECIFICALLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERATION KEYWORDS:
- "think step by step before writing code"
- "first outline the approach, then write the code"
- "explain your reasoning before showing the code"
- "identify edge cases before coding"

DEBUGGING KEYWORDS:
- "analyze this code for bugs"
- "walk through the code step by step"
- "identify possible root causes"
- "propose specific fixes"

================================================================================
PART 15: FINAL TIPS FOR DEVELOPERS
================================================================================

1. USE THE TECHNICAL TERM
   If you know the concept name (Mutex, Circuit Breaker, Memoization),
   use it. The AI will instantly treat you as an expert and respond
   accordingly.

2. IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE TERM
   Ask: "What is the engineering term for when I want to stop my app
   from calling a broken API?"
   Answer: "Circuit Breaker"
   Then use that keyword in your actual prompt.

3. COMBINE KEYWORDS FROM MULTIPLE CATEGORIES
   Role + Task + Quality + Security + Format = Powerful prompt

4. USE CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT FOR COMPLEX PROBLEMS
   Add "Let's think step by step" for math, logic, and debugging.

5. ITERATE
   First draft is rarely perfect. Refine with follow-up keywords:
   "Make it more concise"
   "Add error handling"
   "Show edge cases"

6. BE SPECIFIC
   "Refactor" → "Apply Extract Method to the validation logic"
   "Optimize" → "Reduce time complexity to O(n log n)"
   "Test" → "Write unit tests covering happy path and null inputs"


================================================================================
END OF COMPLETE PROMPT ENGINEERING REFERENCE
================================================================================

You now have the complete vocabulary from Beginner to Architect level.
The "keyword" to unlock the next level is simply knowing the NAME of
what you want. Use these terms, and AI will respond like a colleague.
