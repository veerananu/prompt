================================================================================
PART 1: THE CORE PROBLEM
================================================================================

AI models are PROBABILISTIC — they predict the most likely next word.

This means:
  • Vague questions = vague (or invented) answers
  • Specific questions = accurate, useful answers

Your job as a prompt engineer is to STEER the AI in the right direction.

Think of keywords as STEERING WHEELS:
  • They tell the AI which direction to go
  • How fast to drive
  • What destination to reach

================================================================================
PART 2: THE HALLUCINATION-PROOF FORMULA
================================================================================

FORMULA:
--------
[Context/Data] + [Task] + [Strict Negative Constraint] + [Escape Hatch]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPONENT 1: CONTEXT (Grounding)
--------------------------------
Purpose: Provide the AI with the actual data to work with

BAD:  "What is the return policy of Company X?"
      (Relies on potentially outdated training data)

GOOD: "Context: [Paste the return policy text here]..."
      (AI works only with facts you control)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPONENT 2: TASK
-----------------
Purpose: Tell the AI exactly what to do

Example: "Task: Summarize the refund timeline."

Be specific about the verb:
  • Instead of "help" → use "explain", "fix", "create"
  • Instead of "look at" → use "analyze", "review", "critique"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPONENT 3: STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT
---------------------------------------
Purpose: Build a fence around the AI's behavior

Example: "Answer using only the information provided in the Context above. 
          Do not use outside knowledge."

This prevents the AI from mixing in random stuff from its training data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPONENT 4: ESCAPE HATCH (Crucial!)
------------------------------------
Purpose: Give the AI permission to stop instead of guessing

Example: "If the answer is not contained in the context, state 
          'Information not available'. Do not guess."

WHY THIS WORKS (Engineering View):
LLMs are probabilistic engines. When you ask a vague question, the 
"probability cloud" of potential answers is huge. By adding "If you 
don't know, say stop," you artificially boost the probability of the 
"Stop" token, making it statistically easier for the model to choose 
silence over creativity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPLETE EXAMPLE:
-----------------
"Context: [Paste refund policy here]

Task: Summarize the refund timeline.

Answer using only the information provided in the Context above. 
Do not use outside knowledge.

If the answer is not contained in the context, state 'Information 
not available'. Do not guess."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HANDLING THE "ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY" PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When asking about obscure topics/people that might not exist:

BAD (Assumes existence):
"Who is John Doe from Smalltown, Ohio?"
(Risk: AI invents a persona)

GOOD (Conditional Logic):
"Step 1: Search your database for a 'John Doe' from 'Smalltown, Ohio'. 
 Step 2: If and only if you find a high-confidence match with a public 
         record, summarize his biography. 
 Step 3: If you cannot find a clear match, simply say 'No public record found'."

  • "In [Language/Framework]..."  → "In Python 3.11...", "In React using TypeScript..."
  • "Using [Library]..."          → "Using the Pandas library...", "Using only standard library..."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE "ACTION" KEYWORDS FOR CODING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  • Refactor  → Rewrite code to be cleaner without changing functionality
  • Debug     → Find errors (Tip: paste error message AND code)
  • Optimize  → Focus on performance (speed or memory)
  • Document  → Add comments or generate docstrings
  • Convert   → Translate code from one language to another

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE "CONSTRAINT" KEYWORDS FOR CODING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  • "Code only"      → Stops intro/conclusion, just gives code block
  • "No explanation" → Strictly code
  • "Best practices" → Ensures code follows industry standards
  • "Edge cases"     → Handle weird scenarios (empty lists, nulls, negatives)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODING EXAMPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCENARIO A: Writing New Code
-----------------------------
"Act as a Senior Java Developer. 
 Write a function that validates email addresses. 
 Use regular expressions. 
 Handle null inputs gracefully to avoid crashes. 
 Include Javadoc comments explaining the logic."

SCENARIO B: Debugging
---------------------
"Analyze the following Python code and the error message below. 
 Identify the root cause of the `IndexError`. 
 Propose a fix that checks the list length before accessing it.

 Code: [PASTE CODE]
 Error: [PASTE ERROR]"

SCENARIO C: Understanding Complex Code
--------------------------------------
"Explain this SQL query step-by-step. 
 Break down what each JOIN and WHERE clause is doing. 
 Add comments to the code to explain it for a junior developer."

SCENARIO D: Improving Existing Code
-----------------------------------
"Refactor this JavaScript function to make it cleaner and more readable. 
 Apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. 
 Convert it to use modern ES6 arrow syntax."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIALIZED CODING PHRASES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time Complexity / Big O:
  "Write a sorting algorithm. Ensure the Time Complexity is better than O(n^2)."

Test Cases:
  "Generate code for a calculator. Then, generate 5 unit test cases 
   to prove it works, including division by zero."

Mock Data:
  "Generate a CSV of mock employee data with columns: ID, Name, Salary. 
   Create 20 rows."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CODER'S SHORTCUT PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For fastest results with no fluff:

"[Language]. [Task]. Code only."

Example: "Python. Script to parse a JSON file and save to CSV. Code only."

================================================================================
PART 6: ADVANCED KEYWORDS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUALITY & ROBUSTNESS KEYWORDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  • "Production-ready" → Include error handling, logging, efficient logic
  • "Robust"           → Focus on preventing crashes
  • "Secure/Sanitize"  → Prevent SQL injection, XSS, etc.
  • "Scalable"         → Code that works with small AND large data

Examples:
  "Write a production-ready Python script to upload files to S3."
  "Make this API call robust against network timeouts."
  "Write a SQL query to update users, but sanitize inputs to prevent injection."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN KEYWORDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  • "Design Pattern" → Use Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.

  "Using TDD, write a function that calculates Fibonacci numbers."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE "IDIOMATIC" KEYWORD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Use language-specific features properly ("native speaker" code)

WITHOUT "idiomatic" (generic/C-style Python):
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  even_numbers = []
  for i in range(len(numbers)):
      if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:
          even_numbers.append(numbers[i])

WITH "idiomatic" (Pythonic):
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE "SCAFFOLD" KEYWORD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Build project skeleton quickly

Prompt:
"Generate a project scaffold for a Node.js Express API. 
 Include a standard folder structure and create placeholder files 
 for routes and controllers. Do not implement the business logic yet."

Result:
  /my-api
    /src
      /controllers
        userController.js
      /routes
        userRoutes.js
      app.js
    package.json

================================================================================
PART 7: PRACTICAL EXAMPLES BY USE CASE
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR PROFESSIONAL WRITING (Emails & Reports)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Act as a senior project manager. 
 Draft a concise email to the client updating them on the delay. 
 Tone should be professional but reassuring. 
 Limit to 150 words."

 Fix grammar errors and rephrase awkward sentences. 
 Do not change the technical meaning."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR LEARNING NEW TOPICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Explain 'Cloud Computing' for a 12-year-old (ELI5). 
 Use analogies involving a library to make it easy to understand."

"Simulate a job interview for a Junior Developer role. 
 Ask me one question at a time.

"Write a scary story in the style of Stephen King. 
 Keep the ending ambiguous."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HANDLING THE "ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY" PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When asking about obscure topics/people that might not exist:

BAD (Assumes existence):
"Who is John Doe from Smalltown, Ohio?"
(Risk: AI invents a persona)

GOOD (Conditional Logic):
"Step 1: Search your database for a 'John Doe' from 'Smalltown, Ohio'. 
 Step 2: If and only if you find a high-confidence match with a public 
         record, summarize his biography. 
 Step 3: If you cannot find a clear match, simply say 'No public record found'."

================================================================================
SECTION 1: WHAT IS PROMPT ENGINEERING?
================================================================================

Prompt engineering is learning how to talk to AI so it gives you exactly 
what you need. Think of it as giving clear instructions to a very smart 
assistant who needs specific directions.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: THE BASIC STRUCTURE (BUILDING BLOCKS)
================================================================================

Every good prompt has these building blocks:

    WHO should the AI be?    →  Role
    WHAT do you want?        →  Task
    WHY / background?        →  Context
    HOW should it respond?   →  Output format

Simple Example:
---------------
"You are a Python teacher. Explain what a for loop does in simple terms 
for a beginner. Use a short paragraph."

Breaking it down:
- Role: Python teacher
- Task: Explain what a for loop does
- Context: For a beginner
- Output format: Short paragraph

================================================================================
SECTION 3: TEMPLATE TYPES
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 GENERAL PURPOSE TEMPLATE (Works for almost anything)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEMPLATE:
---------
You are a [role].

Task:
[What do you want? One simple sentence.]

Context:
[Anything the AI should know: project, problem, background.]

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Output format:
[bullets / short paragraph / code only / table / etc.]

Target audience:
[who will read this? e.g., beginner, manager, developer]


EXAMPLE (filled in):
--------------------
You are a Java and Spring Batch expert.

Task:
Explain what this processor does.

Context:
This is part of an ETL job migrating from DataStage.

Requirements:
- Use simple language.
- Point out any obvious problems.
- Suggest 2–3 improvements.

Output format:
Bulleted list.

Target audience:
Junior backend developer.


LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------

"You are a [role]"
→ Telling AI to BE someone changes how it answers.
→ Examples: teacher (simple explanations), expert (technical details)

"Task: [one sentence]"
→ Keep it simple. ONE sentence.
→ BAD: "I need help with code because it's broken and also improve it"
→ GOOD: "Explain what this code does."

"Context: [background]"
→ AI doesn't know your situation unless you tell it.
→ Examples: "This is for beginners", "This runs on limited memory"

"Requirements: [rules]"
→ Your specific rules for AI to follow.

"Output format: [how to present]"
→ Controls HOW AI presents information.
→ Options: bullets, paragraph, code only, table

"Target audience: [who reads this]"
→ Changes complexity of language.
→ Beginner = simple words | Expert = technical terms


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 CODE HELP TEMPLATE (Explain, Debug, or Refactor)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEMPLATE:
---------
I need help with this [language/framework] code.

Goal:
[Explain it / fix an error / refactor it / improve it.]

Context:
[Where it is used, what it should do, any constraints.]

Please:
1. Explain what the code does in simple terms.
2. [Second thing you want: e.g., show possible bugs.]
3. [Third thing you want: e.g., give an improved version.]

Code:
```[language]
[PASTE CODE HERE]
```

Output format:
[bullets + code / code only / explanation only]


WHEN TO USE: You're stuck on a coding problem.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 SUMMARIZATION TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEMPLATE:
---------
Summarize the following text for a [audience: e.g., beginner, manager].

Goal:
[What you want from the summary: key points, action items, etc.]

Length and format:
[Number of bullets / ~X words / short paragraph.]

Text:
"""
[PASTE TEXT HERE]
"""


WHEN TO USE: Long documents, articles, meeting notes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 IMAGE GENERATION TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE FORMULA:
------------
[Subject] + [Action/Context] + [Art Style/Medium] + [Lighting/Color] + [Composition/Camera Angle]


TEMPLATE:
---------
A [subject] [doing what] in [context/place], [art style or medium],
[lighting and colors], [camera angle or composition].


EXPLANATION OF EACH PART:
-------------------------
SUBJECT         = WHO or WHAT is in the image
                  Examples: knight, cat, robot, dragon

ACTION/CONTEXT  = What are they DOING? Where?
                  Examples: standing on cliff, working on laptop

ART STYLE       = How should it LOOK?
                  Examples: watercolor, digital art, anime, 3D render

LIGHTING/COLOR  = What MOOD?
                  Examples: warm orange, neon blue, soft golden

CAMERA ANGLE    = How do we SEE it?
                  Examples: close-up, wide-angle, low-angle


EXAMPLES:
---------
1. A brave knight standing on a cliff overlooking a burning city, 
   realistic digital painting, warm orange and red lighting, 
   dramatic low-angle shot.

2. A cute cat wearing headphones and working on a laptop in a cozy room, 
   anime illustration, soft warm lighting, close-up shot.

3. A futuristic city with flying cars during a rainstorm, 
   cyberpunk digital art, neon blue and purple lighting, 
   wide-angle aerial view.

4. A baby dragon learning to breathe fire with its mother in a cave, 
   watercolor painting, soft golden light from the fire, 
   mid-shot composition.

5. An astronaut planting a flag on an alien planet with strange purple plants, 
   3D render style, high-contrast lighting, 
   wide-angle lens from behind the astronaut.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 DEBUG AN ERROR TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEMPLATE:
---------
I'm getting this error in [language/framework].

1. First, explain in simple words what the error usually means.
2. Then list possible causes in my case.
3. Then show me a fixed version of the code if possible.

Code:
```
[code here]
```

Error:
```
[error message here]
```


LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------

"I'm getting this error in [language/framework]"
→ Tell AI what programming language (Java, Python, etc.)

"1. First, explain in simple words what the error usually means"
→ You're asking AI to explain like a teacher would

"2. Then list possible causes in my case"
→ AI should guess WHY your specific code broke

"3. Then show me a fixed version of the code if possible"
→ You want AI to actually fix it

"Code: [code here]"
→ This is where you paste YOUR broken code

"Error: [error message here]"
→ Paste the EXACT error message you see


WHY THIS STRUCTURE WORKS:
You're giving AI 3 clear jobs:
1. Explain → so you learn
2. List causes → so you understand YOUR problem
3. Fix it → so you can move forward


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6 WRITE NEW CODE TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEMPLATE:
---------
Write [language] code that does the following:
[describe the task clearly]

Requirements:
* Use [framework/library] if needed.
* Follow [style: e.g., clean code, comments, small methods].
* Add [unit tests/logging/comments].


LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------

"Write [language] code that does the following:"
→ Tell AI what language (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)

"[describe the task clearly]"
→ Say EXACTLY what the code should do
→ BAD: "Write code for files"
→ GOOD: "Write code that reads a CSV file and prints each row"

"Use [framework/library] if needed"
→ Do you need specific tools? (React, Spring, Pandas, etc.)

"Follow [style]"
→ How should the code LOOK?
  - Clean code = easy to read
  - Comments = explanations inside code
  - Small methods = break into tiny pieces

"Add [unit tests/logging/comments]"
→ Extra things you want included
  - Unit tests = code that checks if your code works
  - Logging = messages that show what's happening
  - Comments = notes explaining the code


EXAMPLE:
--------
Write Java code that reads a CSV file, maps each row to a Employee object, 
and logs invalid rows.

Requirements:
* Use Spring Batch.
* Follow clean code style with small methods.
* Add basic logging when a row is skipped.


BREAKING DOWN THE EXAMPLE:
--------------------------
"Write Java code"           → Language = Java
"reads a CSV file"          → Input = CSV file
"maps each row to Employee" → Convert data → Java object
"logs invalid rows"         → If row is bad → print a message


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7 REFACTOR CODE TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEMPLATE:
---------
Refactor this [language] code to be more [readable / maintainable / testable].
Keep the same behavior.
Then explain the main changes in a few bullets.

Code:
```
[your code here]
```


LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------

"Refactor this [language] code"
→ "Refactor" means: Make code BETTER without changing what it does

"to be more [readable / maintainable / testable]"
→ READABLE = easier for humans to understand
→ MAINTAINABLE = easier to change later
→ TESTABLE = easier to write tests for

"Keep the same behavior"
→ Don't change WHAT it does, only HOW it's written

"Then explain the main changes in a few bullets"
→ After fixing, tell me what you changed and why


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.8 "DO EVERYTHING" EMERGENCY TEMPLATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use this when you're not sure what to say:

TEMPLATE:
---------
I want help with: [what you're trying to do].

Context: [brief background].

Please:
1. [first thing you want]
2. [second thing you want]
3. [third thing you want]

Output format: [bullets, code only, short paragraph, etc.]


LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:
-------------------------

"I want help with: [what you're trying to do]"
→ State your goal in one sentence

"Context: [brief background]"
→ Give any important background info

"Please: 1. 2. 3."
→ Break your request into numbered steps
→ This helps AI organize its answer

"Output format: [format]"
→ Tell AI HOW to format the answer


EXAMPLE:
--------
I want help with: understanding this Java Spring Batch processor.

Context: This is part of an ETL job migrating from DataStage.

Please:
1. Explain what the code does in simple terms
2. Point out any obvious problems
3. Suggest a cleaner version of the code

Output format: bullets + revised Java code


================================================================================
SECTION 4: GOLDEN RULES
================================================================================

RULE 1: BE SPECIFIC
-------------------
Vague prompts = vague answers

BAD:  "Help me with code"
GOOD: "Explain what this Python function does and fix the syntax error"


RULE 2: GIVE CONTEXT
--------------------
AI doesn't know your situation

BAD:  "Write an email"
GOOD: "Write a follow-up email to a client who hasn't responded to my proposal"


RULE 3: BREAK BIG TASKS INTO STEPS
----------------------------------
Easier for AI to follow

BAD:  "Create a complete website"
GOOD: "First, create the HTML structure. Then, add CSS styling. 
       Finally, add JavaScript for the menu."


RULE 4: ASK FOR EXAMPLES
------------------------
Helps clarify what you need

"Explain recursion and give me 2 simple examples"


RULE 5: ITERATE AND REFINE
--------------------------
First try not perfect? Adjust and retry

First prompt:  "Summarize this article"
Refined:       "Summarize this article in 3 bullets, focus on the main argument"


================================================================================
SECTION 5: TRIGGER WORDS REFERENCE
================================================================================

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
-------------------------
❌ Being too vague: "Help me with my project"
❌ No context: "Write an email"
❌ Too many things at once: "Build me a full application"
❌ No format specified: AI might give wrong format
❌ Forgetting the audience: Answer might be too complex or too simple

        PROMPT ENGINEERING - COMPLETE BEGINNER'S GUIDE (LINE BY LINE)
================================================================================

What is Prompt Engineering?
---------------------------
It's simply HOW YOU ASK AI QUESTIONS to get better answers. 
Think of it like learning how to give clear instructions to a very smart 
but literal assistant.


================================================================================
                    SECTION 1: DOCUMENTATION/EXPLANATION TEMPLATE
================================================================================

Original Template:
------------------
> Explain the following code/concept in simple terms for [audience].
> Include:
> 1. A high-level summary (2–3 sentences).
> 2. A line-by-line walkthrough.
> 3. One example of how to use it in practice.

Line-by-Line Breakdown:
-----------------------
LINE: "Explain the following code/concept in simple terms for [audience]"
  → What to do: Tell the AI to explain something simply
  → [audience] = You fill this in (like "beginner" or "kid")

LINE: "1. A high-level summary (2–3 sentences)"
  → Ask for a SHORT OVERVIEW first (the big picture)

LINE: "2. A line-by-line walkthrough"
  → Then ask for DETAILED EXPLANATION of each part

LINE: "3. One example of how to use it in practice"
  → Finally, ask for a REAL EXAMPLE you can copy/use


================================================================================
                    SECTION 2: IMAGE PROMPT FORMULA
================================================================================

Original Template:
------------------
> Generate an image of [Subject] [Action] in [Context], in [Art style], 
> with [Lighting & color], using [Composition / camera angle].

The Formula:
------------
[Subject] + [Action/Context] + [Art Style] + [Lighting/Color] + [Camera/Composition]

Breaking Down Each Part:
------------------------
PART            WHAT IT MEANS                   EXAMPLE
----            -------------                   -------
[Subject]       Who or what is in the picture   a robot, a cat, a warrior
[Action]        What are they doing             running, sleeping, fighting
[Context]       Where is this happening         in a forest, on Mars, at home
[Art style]     What style of art               watercolor, anime, realistic
[Lighting]      How is it lit, what colors      warm sunset, neon blue, dark
[Composition]   Camera angle/view               close-up, wide shot, bird's eye

EXAMPLE 1:
----------
"A futuristic robot playing chess in a neon-lit park, Synthwave digital art 
style, pink and blue lighting, wide-angle lens."

Breakdown:
  • Subject     → futuristic robot
  • Action      → playing chess
  • Context     → in a neon-lit park
  • Art Style   → Synthwave digital art
  • Lighting    → pink and blue lighting
  • Camera      → wide-angle lens

EXAMPLE 2:
----------
"A cute baby dragon sleeping on a pile of gold in a cave, watercolor 
illustration, warm golden light, close-up shot."

Breakdown:
  • Subject     → cute baby dragon
  • Action      → sleeping
  • Context     → on a pile of gold in a cave
  • Art Style   → watercolor illustration
  • Lighting    → warm golden light
  • Camera      → close-up shot


================================================================================
                    SECTION 3: DELIMITERS (7 TYPES)
================================================================================

What are Delimiters?
--------------------
Delimiters are like WALLS or BOXES that separate your instructions from 
your content. They help AI know: "This is what I should DO" vs "This is 
the TEXT to work on."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE 1: TRIPLE QUOTES """
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
--------
Summarize the following article:

"""
Climate change is affecting global temperatures. Scientists report that 
2024 was the hottest year on record. Many countries are now implementing 
new environmental policies.
"""

What's Happening:
  • """ opens the text block
  • The article text goes inside
  • """ closes the text block
  • AI knows: "Summarize ONLY what's between the quotes"

Best For: Blocks of text, articles, paragraphs


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE 2: XML TAGS <tag></tag>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
--------
You are a translator.

<input_text>
I love programming.
</input_text>

<target_language>
Spanish
</target_language>

Translate the input text to the target language.

What's Happening:
  LINE                        MEANING
  ----                        -------
  "You are a translator."     Tells AI its role
  <input_text>                Opens the "input" box
  "I love programming."       The text to translate
  </input_text>               Closes the "input" box
  <target_language>           Opens the "language" box
  "Spanish"                   The language you want
  </target_language>          Closes the "language" box
  "Translate..."              The instruction

Best For: Complex prompts with multiple parts, very clear separation


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE 3: MARKDOWN HEADERS ###
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
--------
### Role
You are a helpful teacher.

### Task
Explain this concept simply.

### Concept
Photosynthesis

### Audience
10-year-old student

What's Happening:
  LINE                          MEANING
  ----                          -------
  ### Role                      Section title: "What is the AI's job?"
  "You are a helpful teacher."  AI should act like a teacher
  ### Task                      Section title: "What should AI do?"
  "Explain this concept..."     The action to take
  ### Concept                   Section title: "What topic?"
  "Photosynthesis"              The topic to explain
  ### Audience                  Section title: "For whom?"
  "10-year-old student"         Keep it simple for a kid

Best For: Organized prompts with clear sections


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE 4: COLONS AND LABELS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
--------
INSTRUCTION: Fix the grammar errors.
TEXT: She go to school yesterday and buyed a book.
OUTPUT FORMAT: Corrected sentence only.

What's Happening:
  LINE                          MEANING
  ----                          -------
  INSTRUCTION:                  Label for what to do
  "Fix the grammar errors."     The task
  TEXT:                         Label for the input
  "She go to school..."         The broken sentence
  OUTPUT FORMAT:                Label for how to answer
  "Corrected sentence only."    Don't explain, just fix it

Best For: Simple, structured prompts


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE 5: DASHES ---
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
--------
Review the code below for bugs.

---
def add(a, b)
    return a + b
---

List any errors found.

What's Happening:
  LINE                    MEANING
  ----                    -------
  "Review the code..."    Instruction
  ---                     "Code starts here"
  def add(a, b)...        The actual code
  ---                     "Code ends here"
  "List any errors..."    What to output

Best For: Simple separation, code blocks


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE 6: BRACKETS [ ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
--------
Write an email with these details:

[TONE]: Professional
[PURPOSE]: Meeting request
[RECIPIENT]: Manager

What's Happening:
  LINE              MEANING
  ----              -------
  "Write an email"  The main task
  [TONE]:           Setting: How should it sound?
  "Professional"    Formal, businesslike
  [PURPOSE]:        Setting: Why are we writing?
  "Meeting request" To ask for a meeting
  [RECIPIENT]:      Setting: Who is it for?
  "Manager"         Your boss

Best For: Settings, parameters, configurations


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE 7: BEGIN/END MARKERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
--------
Extract all names from this text:

BEGIN TEXT
John met Sarah at the coffee shop. Later, Michael joined them.
END TEXT

What's Happening:
  LINE                    MEANING
  ----                    -------
  "Extract all names..."  The task
  BEGIN TEXT              "The text starts now"
  "John met Sarah..."     The actual content
  END TEXT                "The text ends here"

AI Will Find: John, Sarah, Michael

Best For: Clear boundaries, processing text


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BAD vs GOOD EXAMPLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BAD (No Delimiter):
  Translate hello world to French

  Problem: AI might get confused about what exactly to translate

GOOD (With Delimiter):
  Translate the following to French:
  """
  hello world
  """

  Why Better: Clear instruction first, """ shows exactly what to translate


================================================================================
                    SECTION 4: THE 6 PROMPTING TACTICS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TACTIC 1: SET CLEAR GOALS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule: Say EXACTLY what you want.

BAD:  "Write about dogs"
GOOD: "Write a 100-word paragraph about dogs for kids"

Formula: ACTION + FORMAT + LENGTH + AUDIENCE

  PART        EXAMPLES
  ----        --------
  Action      Write, Summarize, Explain, List, Compare
  Format      bullets, paragraph, list, table
  Length      5 bullets, 200 words, 3 paragraphs
  Audience    beginner, expert, kid, manager


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TACTIC 2: GIVE CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule: Tell the AI what this is about and what it's for.

Examples:
  • "This is for a school project about climate change. Summarize the main 
     points in simple language."
  
  • "Based on this financial report, explain if the company is doing better 
     or worse."
  
  • "I'm a beginner learning Python. Explain this code simply."

Why? More context = AI understands better = better answer


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TACTIC 3: FEW-SHOT PROMPTING (SHOW EXAMPLES)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule: Show one or two examples of what you want, then say "Now do it for this"

Example:
--------
Example:
Input: Cat → Output: A small furry mammal with whiskers.
Input: Dog → Output: A domesticated canine known for its loyalty.

Now do the same for: Elephant.

What's Happening:
  1. You show AI: "Cat looks like THIS"
  2. You show AI: "Dog looks like THIS"
  3. You say: "Now do Elephant the same way"

AI learns the PATTERN from your examples!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TACTIC 4: BE SPECIFIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule: Vague = bad results. Specific = good results.

BAD (Vague)                     GOOD (Specific)
-----------                     ---------------
"Write about dogs"              "Write 3 paragraphs about dog training 
                                 for beginners"

"Help with code"                "Fix this Python function that 
                                 calculates tax"

"Make it better"                "Make this email more professional 
                                 and shorter"

"Write something about          "Write a persuasive paragraph arguing 
climate change"                  why we should reduce carbon emissions, 
                                 150–200 words"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TACTIC 5: ITERATE (TRY, FIX, TRY AGAIN)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule: If the answer is not good, tell the AI to adjust.

Common Adjustments:
  • "Make it shorter."
  • "Make it longer."
  • "Use simpler words."
  • "Add an example."
  • "Be more specific."
  • "Make it more formal."
  • "Make it more casual."

Key Point: It's NORMAL to try 2-3 times. Don't expect perfect on first try!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TACTIC 6: CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (STEP-BY-STEP)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule: Ask the AI to show its thinking steps.

Phrases to Use:
  • "Solve this step-by-step."
  • "Explain your reasoning."
  • "First list assumptions, then give the answer."
  • "Think through this carefully."
  • "Show your work."

When to Use: Math, logic, decisions, complex problems, debugging

================================================================================
                    1. WHAT IS PROMPT ENGINEERING?
================================================================================

It's the skill of asking AI questions in a way that gets you the best answers.

Think of it like this:
- Bad question to a person: "Help me with stuff"
- Good question to a person: "Can you proofread this email and fix grammar mistakes?"

The same applies to AI. Better instructions = Better results.


================================================================================
                    2. THE BASIC STRUCTURE (3 PARTS)
================================================================================

Every good prompt has three parts:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. WHO should the AI be?               │
│     "You are a helpful doctor"          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. WHAT do you want?                   │
│     "Explain headaches to me"           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. HOW should it respond?              │
│     "Use simple words, 3 bullet points" │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example:
"You are a friendly teacher. Explain what gravity is to a 10-year-old. 
Use 3 short sentences."

                    3. THE 5 BUILDING BLOCKS
================================================================================

----------------------
3.1 CONTEXT (Background Info)
----------------------

Tell the AI WHY you need this.

Without Context              With Context
--------------               ------------
"Write an email"             "I missed a meeting with my boss. 
                              Write an apology email."

The AI now understands the situation.


----------------------
3.2 TASK (What To Do)
----------------------

Be SPECIFIC about what you want.

Vague                        Specific
-----                        --------
"Help with my code"          "Find the bug in this Python function"
"Write something about dogs" "Write 5 fun facts about golden retrievers"


----------------------
3.3 FORMAT (How It Should Look)
----------------------

Tell the AI HOW to present the answer.

Examples:
- "Give me a numbered list"
- "Write it as a table"
- "Keep it under 100 words"
- "Use JSON format"


----------------------
3.4 EXAMPLES (Show What You Want)
----------------------

This is called "few-shot prompting". You show the AI an example first.

    Convert these to past tense:

    Example:
    - Input: "I walk"
    - Output: "I walked"

    Now do this one:
    - Input: "She runs"

The AI learns the pattern from your example.


----------------------
3.5 ROLE (Who The AI Should Be)
----------------------

Give the AI a character to play.

Role                         Effect
----                         ------
"You are a lawyer"           Formal, precise language
"You are a kindergarten      Simple, friendly explanations
 teacher"
"You are a comedian"         Funny, casual responses


================================================================================
                    4. THE 4 MAIN JOBS YOU CAN GIVE AI
================================================================================

JOB 1: CREATE SOMETHING NEW
---------------------------
"Write a poem about rain"
"Generate 10 fake customer reviews"

JOB 2: SUMMARIZE SOMETHING LONG
-------------------------------
"Summarize this 10-page report in 5 bullets"

JOB 3: TRANSLATE OR CONVERT
---------------------------
"Translate this to Spanish"
"Convert this Python code to JavaScript"

JOB 4: PRETEND TO BE SOMEONE
----------------------------
"Act as an angry customer so I can practice my response"


================================================================================
                    5. TYPES OF QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Question Type     What It Does          Example
-------------     ------------          -------
Open              Explore broadly       "Explain climate change"
Closed            Get one fact          "What year did WW2 end?"
Multiple Choice   Pick from options     "Is the answer A, B, or C?"
Hypothetical      Imagine scenarios     "What if cars could fly?"
Opinion           Argue a position      "Why might someone oppose this?"


================================================================================
                    6. USING SEPARATORS (DELIMITERS)
================================================================================

Separators help the AI know WHERE your instructions end and your data begins.

Without separator (confusing):
    Translate hello world to French

With separator (clear):
    Translate the following to French:

    """
    hello world
    """

COMMON SEPARATORS:

Type              Looks Like
----              ----------
Triple quotes     """text here"""
XML tags          <text>content</text>
Dashes            --- code here ---
Markdown headers  ### Section Name
Brackets          [TONE]: Professional
BEGIN/END         BEGIN TEXT ... END TEXT


================================================================================
                    7. THE S.P.E.C. RULE FOR CODE TASKS
================================================================================

This is a checklist for 4 things you should always tell AI when asking for code.

Letter    Word        Meaning
------    ----        -------
S         Stack       What language/tools to use
P         Pattern     How to structure the code
E         Errors      What problems to handle
C         Comments    Explain the code


----------------------
S = STACK (The Tools)
----------------------

Tell the AI what programming language and version to use.

Why? Different versions have different features.

Bad                          Good
---                          ----
"Write code for this"        "Write this in Python 3.10"
"Make a website"             "Use JavaScript ES6 and React"

More examples:
- "Use Java 17"
- "Use Python with the Pandas library"
- "Use Node.js version 18"


----------------------
P = PATTERN (The Structure)
----------------------

Tell the AI how to organize the code.

Pattern                      What It Means
-------                      -------------
"Write it as a function"     One block of reusable code
"Write it as a class"        Object-oriented with methods
"Use functional style"       No classes, just pure functions
"Follow REST API pattern"    For web services

Bad:  "Write code to manage users"
Good: "Write a User class with methods for create, read, update, delete"


----------------------
E = ERRORS (Handle Problems)
----------------------

Tell the AI what can go wrong and how to deal with it.

Situation                    What To Handle
---------                    --------------
User enters nothing          Empty input
User enters letters          Wrong type
  instead of numbers
File doesn't exist           Missing file
Internet is down             Connection failure

Bad:  "Write a function to divide two numbers"
Good: "Write a function to divide two numbers. Handle divide by zero."


----------------------
C = COMMENTS (Explain The Code)
----------------------

Tell the AI to add notes inside the code.

Type               Purpose
----               -------
Inline comments    Explain one line
Docstrings         Explain a whole function
Header comments    Explain the whole file

Bad:  "Write a sorting function"
Good: "Write a sorting function with comments explaining each step"


----------------------
S.P.E.C. EXAMPLE
----------------------

BAD PROMPT (Missing S.P.E.C.):
"Write code to calculate the average of numbers"

GOOD PROMPT (Using S.P.E.C.):
"Write a Python 3.10 function that calculates the average of a list.
Requirements:
- Write it as a single function (Pattern)
- Handle empty lists and non-numeric values (Errors)
- Add a docstring and inline comments (Comments)"


----------------------
S.P.E.C. QUICK REFERENCE

================================================================================
                    8. THE MASTER PROMPT TEMPLATE
================================================================================

This is the foundational structure for writing effective prompts.


----------------------
PART 1: SYSTEM MESSAGE
----------------------

Sets the AI's identity. Keep this short.

    You are an expert [JOB TITLE] who specializes in [SPECIFIC SKILL].


----------------------
PART 2: USER MESSAGE
----------------------

This is where you give the actual instructions. It has five components:

Component              Purpose                    Example
---------              -------                    -------
<context>              Background, audience,      "I'm writing for non-technical
                       goal                        managers"
<task_instruction>     The specific action        "Analyze this data and extract
                                                   top 3 errors"
<documents>            Your raw data/text/code    Paste your content here
<examples>             Show input/output pairs    Demonstrates format you want
<formatting_           Constraints (positive)     "Use professional tone"
 requirements>                                    NOT "Don't be casual"


----------------------
PART 3: PREFILL
----------------------

You start the AI's response to force a specific format.

    Here is the analysis in JSON format: <json>{

By typing the opening bracket, you guarantee JSON output without the AI 
saying "Sure, I'd be happy to help!"


================================================================================
                    9. THE FOUR MASTER TEMPLATES
================================================================================

----------------------
TEMPLATE 1: UNIVERSAL (R-C-T-F Framework)
----------------------

For open-ended or opinion questions:

    # ROLE
    Act as an expert [Data Scientist, Writer, etc.].

    # CONTEXT
    I am working on [project/goal].

    # TASK
    [Specific instruction]

    # CONSTRAINTS & FORMAT
    - Tone: [Professional, Humorous, ELI5]
    - Length: [under 200 words]
    - Output Format: [Bullets, Table, JSON]


----------------------
TEMPLATE 2: SENIOR DEVELOPER CODE TEMPLATE
----------------------

Forces quality coding standards:

    # PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
    [Python 3.10, JavaScript ES6, etc.]

    # THE GOAL
    I need a function that [functionality].

    # REQUIREMENTS
    1. Robustness: Handle edge cases, include try/catch
    2. Style: Follow PEP8 / standard guides
    3. Documentation: Include docstrings explaining WHY
    4. Efficiency: Aim for low time complexity

    # INPUT DATA (Optional)
    [Sample data or variable names]

    # OUTPUT
    Code block, then brief error-handling explanation.


----------------------
TEMPLATE 3: TRUTH-SEEKER QA TEMPLATE (RAG)
----------------------

Prevents hallucinations by restricting to provided text:

    # INSTRUCTION
    Answer using ONLY the provided context.
    - Do not use outside knowledge.
    - If answer isn't in text, say "I do not know."
    - Cite the sentence where you found it.

    # QUESTION
    [Your specific question]

    # CONTEXT TEXT
    """
    [Paste article, email, or data]
    """


----------------------
TEMPLATE 4: CRITIQUE TEMPLATE (Refinement)
----------------------

When the first answer isn't quite right:

    # CRITIQUE REQUEST
    Review your previous response.
    1. Identify logic gaps, security issues, or errors.
    2. Rate your answer 1-10.
    3. Rewrite to be a 10/10, fixing all issues.


================================================================================
                    10. IMAGE PROMPT FORMULA
================================================================================

For consistent AI image generation:

[Subject] + [Action/Context] + [Art Style/Medium] + [Lighting/Color] + [Composition/Camera Angle]

Example:
"A futuristic robot playing chess in a neon-lit park, Synthwave digital art 
style, pink and blue lighting, wide-angle lens."

More examples:

Fantasy character:
"A female elf archer drawing her bow in an ancient forest, digital painting 
in semi-realistic fantasy style, soft golden hour lighting, low-angle perspective."

Tech scene:
"A software engineer typing on a laptop in a high-tech office at night, 
cyberpunk illustration, cool blue and purple lighting, over-the-shoulder view."


================================================================================
                    11. QUICK IMPROVEMENT TRICKS
================================================================================

THE GOLDEN RULE: POSITIVE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------

Don't say what you DON'T want. Say what you DO want.

Bad (Negative)               Good (Positive)
--------------               ---------------
"Don't be formal"            "Use casual, friendly language"
"Don't write too much"       "Keep it under 50 words"
"Don't use jargon"           "Use words a beginner would understand"


QUICK FIXES
-----------

If the answer is...          Try adding...
-------------------          -------------
Too long                     "Keep it under 50 words"
Too vague                    "Give 3 specific examples"
Too technical                "Explain like I'm 12"
Wrong format                 "Output as a numbered list"
Missing details              "Include X, Y, and Z"


THE SIX CORE TACTICS
--------------------

1. Set Clear Goals
   Always include: Action verb + Format/Length + Topic + Audience

2. Provide Context
   Tell the AI what's going on, give facts, define terms.

3. Use Few-Shot Prompting
   Show 1-2 examples of input→output, then say "Now do the same for..."

4. Be Specific
   Quantify ("Give 3 options"), decompose ("First do X, then Y, then Z").

5. Iterate & Experiment
   Prompt → Evaluate → Tweak → Repeat.

6. Chain-of-Thought
   Ask: "Show your reasoning step-by-step"


================================================================================
                    12. READY-MADE PROMPT SKELETONS

                    END OF GUIDE
================================================================================

Remember: Better instructions = Better results!

The key is to be SPECIFIC about:
- WHO the AI should be
- WHAT you want it to do
- HOW you want the output formatted
- WHAT to do when things go wrong

Practice these templates and you'll get much better results from AI.

================================================================================

# How to Talk to AI (Explained Simply!)

Think of AI like a really smart helper who wants to do a good job, but needs very clear instructions. Here's how to talk to it:

---

## Tip 1: Use Labels

Imagine you have a messy backpack. If you put your lunch in one pocket, your pencils in another, and your homework in another, it's easy to find stuff!

Same with AI. Instead of one big messy paragraph, you label things:
- "Here's the story I wrote"
- "Here's what I want you to do"

Labels help AI know what's what.

---

## Tip 2: Be Super Clear

Pretend you're explaining something to someone who takes everything *exactly* as you say it.

Bad: "Make it short." (Short like... one word? One page?)

Good: "Write exactly 3 sentences."

Don't make the AI guess what you mean!

---

## Tip 3: Talk the Way You Want It to Talk

If you type like this:
"hey can u help me lol"

The AI thinks you want a casual, silly answer.

If you type like this:
"Please help me write a professional letter."

The AI gives you something more serious.

It's like a mirror—it copies your style!

---

## Tip 4: Check Your Spelling

Would you turn in homework with messy handwriting and spelling mistakes? Probably not if you want a good grade!

Same idea. If your question has lots of typos, the AI might give you a messier answer. Clean writing = clean answers.

---

## Tip 5: Use the Language You Know Best

If you speak Spanish at home and English at school, it's okay to ask the AI your question in Spanish! Even if you want the answer in English.

The AI is really good at translating. It's better to ask clearly in your best language than to ask confusingly in a language you're still learning.

---

## Tip 6: Give It a Head Start

This is like fill-in-the-blank!

Instead of saying "Give me a list," you could write:

"Here is my list:
1."

Now the AI knows EXACTLY how to start. It just fills in the rest!

---

## Tip 7: Say What You Want (Not What You Don't Want)

If I say "DON'T think about pizza"... you just thought about pizza, right?

Same with AI!

Don't say: "Don't write too much."

Do say: "Write only 2 sentences."

Tell it what TO do, not what NOT to do.

---

## Tip 8: Put Important Stuff Where It Can See It

If you whisper instructions from far away, someone might not hear you.

Put your important instructions right in your main message where the AI will definitely see them. Don't hide them!

---

## The Big Rule: Don't Use AI for Everything

AI is great at writing stories, explaining things, and being creative.

But for math problems or putting things in ABC order? A calculator or computer program is faster and never makes mistakes.

Use the right tool for the job! You wouldn't use a hammer to brush your teeth, right?

---

The short version: Be clear, be neat, and tell the AI exactly what you want. It's like giving directions—the clearer you are, the better it can help you!








================================================================================
                        TREE OF THOUGHTS (ToT) PROMPTING
================================================================================

WHAT IS IT?
-----------
Tree of Thoughts is a prompting framework that explores multiple reasoning 
paths simultaneously, rather than following a single chain of thought.

Think of it like a maze:
- Regular prompting = Walk forward, get stuck at dead ends
- Tree of Thoughts = Explore multiple paths, keep the good ones


================================================================================
                              THE KEY IDEA
================================================================================

Step 1: Think of MULTIPLE OPTIONS (not just one)
Step 2: JUDGE each option: good or bad?
Step 3: KEEP the good ones, DROP the bad ones
Step 4: Repeat until you find the best answer


================================================================================
                           PROMPT TEMPLATES
================================================================================

------------------------
BASIC TEMPLATE
------------------------

Solve this problem: [YOUR PROBLEM]

Step 1 - BRAINSTORM
Think of 3 different approaches to solve this.

Approach A:
Approach B:
Approach C:

Step 2 - EVALUATE
Rate each approach (good / maybe / bad) and explain why.

Step 3 - EXPAND
Take the best approach and develop it further.
If stuck, go back and try another approach.

Step 4 - FINALIZE
Give your final answer.


------------------------
SIMPLE VERSION
------------------------

Problem: [YOUR PROBLEM]

Give me 3 possible solutions.
Then pick the best one and explain why.


------------------------
DETAILED VERSION
------------------------

I need you to solve this step by step using multiple paths.

Problem: [YOUR PROBLEM]

PHASE 1 - GENERATE IDEAS
List 3 different ways to approach this problem.

PHASE 2 - EVALUATE EACH
For each approach, ask:
- Does this make progress toward the goal?
- Rate it: promising / uncertain / dead end

PHASE 3 - GO DEEPER
Pick the most promising approach.
Break it into smaller steps.
If it fails, backtrack and try another.

PHASE 4 - SOLUTION
Present your final answer.


------------------------
ONE-LINER VERSION
------------------------

Think of 3 ways to solve this, evaluate each, then pursue the best one: [YOUR PROBLEM]


================================================================================
                             REAL EXAMPLES
================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: Creative Writing
---------------------------

Problem: Write a story about a robot who learns to love.

Step 1: Give me 3 possible story directions.

Step 2: Evaluate each - which is most original and emotional?

Step 3: Take the best one and outline the plot.

Step 4: Write the story.


EXAMPLE 2: Decision Making (Dinner)
-----------------------------------

Question: What should I have for dinner?

Regular prompting (one thought):
    I'm hungry → I'll make pasta → done

Tree of Thoughts (multiple thoughts):
    I'm hungry
        ├── Option A: Pasta
        │       → Easy to make ✓
        │       → Had it yesterday ✗
        │       
        ├── Option B: Salad  
        │       → Healthy ✓
        │       → Not filling ✗
        │       
        └── Option C: Stir fry
                → Healthy ✓
                → Have ingredients ✓
                → Winner! ✓


EXAMPLE 3: Math (Game of 24)
----------------------------

Problem: Use 4, 5, 6, 6 with +, −, ×, ÷ to make 24

Step 1 - Generate possible first operations:
    Branch A: 4 + 5 = 9  → Remaining: 9, 6, 6
    Branch B: 5 × 6 = 30 → Remaining: 30, 4, 6
    Branch C: 6 − 4 = 2  → Remaining: 2, 5, 6

Step 2 - Evaluate each branch:
    Branch A: maybe
    Branch B: promising
    Branch C: maybe

Step 3 - Expand best branches, backtrack if stuck

Step 4 - Solution: 4 × 6 × (6 ÷ 6) = 24 ✓
